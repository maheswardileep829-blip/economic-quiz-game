# Economics Quiz Game

A Python-based multiple choice quiz to study economic terms and concepts for DECA competitions.

## Features

- 20 economic terms with definitions
- Multiple choice format (4 options per question)
- Smart wrong answers (uses definitions from other terms)
- Randomized questions each time
- Score tracking and percentage calculation

- Microeconomics: Supply, Demand, Monopoly, Market Economy
- Finance: Interest Rate, Stock, Dividend, Revenue, Profit
- Business: Asset, Liability, Equity, Capital, Opportunity Cost
